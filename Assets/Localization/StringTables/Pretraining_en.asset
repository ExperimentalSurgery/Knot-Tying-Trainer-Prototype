    m_Localized: Let's start with first, simple steps and begin with the preparations
      for later knot processes. On the table in front of you will see a knot bank.
      This consists of two strands, which we want to tie together with a knot.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 403796144128
    m_Localized: Pass the thread under both strands.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 601767292928
    m_Localized: It's very simple - I'll show you.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 4628605317120
    m_Localized: Now please pull lightly on both ends so that there is some tension
      on the thread. When the system detects the correct amount of tension, it will
      continue.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 5811793309696
    m_Localized: I'll do it again for you.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 6157886304256
    m_Localized: Very nice. That was quite simple.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 6286148120576
    m_Localized: Now I will cross the thread once, that is, lead it once around the
      material to be knotted.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 6416377065472
    m_Localized: We tie with the right hand, so after crossing the left end must
      be down, i.e. closer to you
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 6546966720512
    m_Localized: First look at how I do it and also cross the two ends of the thread.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: When you are done please show me a thumbs up.

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 10700191707136
    m_Localized: Super! I see already. We understand each other. Let's get on with
      it.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 776125590052864
    m_Localized: Pick up each half of the thread between your thumb and index finger.
      Grasp the loose thread ends with the remaining fingers.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 776301767598080
    m_Localized: This sounds complicated, as you can see, I use my pinky, ring finger
      and middle finger to form a tube through which the thread runs.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 776486484746240
    m_Localized: Now do it yourself, now cross the thread. Hold the threads as described
      and shown.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 776692848697344
    m_Localized: That's not quite it yet.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 776861702987776
    m_Localized: You need to grasp the thread between your index finger and thumb.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 777000618336256
    m_Localized: Please tighten the thread a little more to get a tight knot.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 777022990753792
    m_Localized: Please relax the thread a little so as not to cause a skin tear
      later.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 777167929122816
    m_Localized: Super! That worked well!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 777330127052800
    m_Localized: This is your starting position. Every node starts in this state.
      As you can see, the system always confirms a successful position by briefly
      lighting your hands green.
